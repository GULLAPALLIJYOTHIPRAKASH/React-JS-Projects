# 🚀 Pagination with Data Caching in React

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project implements a dynamic **pagination system** in **React.js**, allowing users to navigate seamlessly through pages while efficiently **fetching and caching user data**. The data is retrieved from the **Random Users API** and stored in **local storage** to minimize redundant network requests for previously visited pages.

## ✨ Features  

### 🔹 Efficient Data Fetching & Caching  
- Fetches data asynchronously using the **Fetch API**.  
- Caches API responses in **local storage**, reducing unnecessary network requests.  

### 🔹 Pagination Navigation  
- Users can navigate through pages using **page numbers**.  
- **Previous** and **Next** buttons allow easy movement between pages.  
- **Active page indication** helps users track their current page.  

### 🔹 User Profile Navigation  
- Uses **React Router DOM** for navigating to user profiles.  
- Profiles persist even after **refreshing or reopening** the app.  

### 🔹 Responsive & Modern UI  
- Fully responsive design, adapting to **mobile, tablet, and desktop** screens.  
- Styled with a **modern and fresh UI** for a better user experience.  

### 🔹 Persistent Data  
- **Local storage** ensures that previously fetched data remains available, even after the user closes or refreshes the browser.
