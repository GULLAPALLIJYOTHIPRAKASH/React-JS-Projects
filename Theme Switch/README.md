## Key Features:

- **✅ Toggle Animation**: Smooth transitions using CSS animations for a better user experience.

- **🌙 Dark/Light Mode**: Changes global styles or classNames using useState, useEffect, and context (if used globally).

- **💾 Persistent State**: Used localStorage to remember the user's theme preference.

- **⚛️ React Hooks**: Utilized useState and useEffect for dynamic UI updates and state syncing.
