# 📊 Scroll Progress Bar with API Data – React.js

A modern **scroll progress bar** built using **React.js**, which visually indicates how much of the page has been scrolled. This interactive UI element enhances user engagement. Additionally, the project fetches and displays data from a public API to populate scrollable content.
